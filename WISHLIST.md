# WISHLIST

- ping when tourney opens
- ping when tourney is 1 hour to close
- ping when tourney closes
- ping when claim rewards
- track users throughout entirety of tourney, don't dump them off after they leave the queue, this lets us see who historically already joined as well
- leaderboard of some sort!
- make persistent in some way, docker, or GCP would be fitting
- set up automation to deploy changes to bot on push?
