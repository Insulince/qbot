# WISHLIST

- track users throughout entirety of tourney, don't dump them off after they leave the queue, this lets us see who historically already joined as well
- disable tags where applicable
- !bcs for battle conditions maybe?
- add !clearwave or something to remove yourself from the active tourney leaderboard
- merge !leaderboard and !history? They serve similar functions, could be combined maybe
- separate out mod and normal commands in qbot.go
- setup error handling to also handle when panics occur and route those to the error channel as well.
- need to ensure that when an error occurs, the bot doesnt just stay silent, but tells the user something went wrong
- announcement system? announce when timed things reset? daily missions are released, crates reset, event starts, etc.?
- add pic to @everyone chats from Q
