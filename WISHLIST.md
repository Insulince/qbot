# WISHLIST

- track users throughout entirety of tourney, don't dump them off after they leave the queue, this lets us see who historically already joined as well
- disable tags where applicable
- !bcs for battle conditions maybe?
- add !clearwave or something to remove yourself from the active tourney leaderboard
- merge !leaderboard and !history? They serve similar functions, could be combined maybe
- separate out mod and normal commands in qbot.go
- setup error handling to also handle when panics occur and route those to the error channel as well.
- need to ensure that when an error occurs, the bot doesnt just stay silent, but tells the user something went wrong
- announcement system? announce when timed things reset? daily missions are released, crates reset, event starts, etc.?
- !roast
- command to extract a players progress out of past tournament results. Something like !progress <username>, and it would scan over all tournament entries for that player and output them, maybe with a delta or something
- Add specific `help` sub commands to each command
- User specific history + graphing?
- different tiers in tourney tracking
- !walkie
- !shame - shame someone who either forgets their turn in the queue, or someone who skips the queue entirely
- LLM? Local vs API?
- Can !enter be skipped entirely, and !q just assumes you have already joined?
- cross-server interactions are confusing, it needs to be tightened up if this is going to work
- john travolta looking aorund meme when someone times out
- "this is fine" when someone !enter out of turn
- unify the message sending process into a single `post` and `mustPost` function that accepts options for enabling different functionalities. Consider making it its own package.
- humanization of repsonses via llm
- humanize only a % of the time to keep the feeling consistent, maybe 50% of the time
- use placeholders for things which shoudl not be replaced, and swap them in after
  - Rewrite the following message to sound more natural and conversational by mildly varying the wording and sentence structure, but do not change the meaning in any way. Preserve all markdown formatting such as asterisks (*) and underscores (_). Keep any numbers, usernames, and special terms exactly the same. Make sure the message remains clear and accurate.*
- leaderboard messages are now so long that they get cutoff mid-name
- 
- !q outside of tourney times should meme the dude tryna use it
- levenshtein distance
- `!predict`, to submit a wave count for the upcoming tourney or something. have it react to how right or wrong you we
  - could even have some sort of wager, but like fake money, still that gets a bit complicated
- Q sends DMs to people who haven't yet done a run but normall do, or something like that
