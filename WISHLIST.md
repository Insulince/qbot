# WISHLIST

- track users throughout entirety of tourney, don't dump them off after they leave the queue, this lets us see who historically already joined as well
- disable tags where applicable
- !bcs for battle conditions maybe?
- add !clearwave or something to remove yourself from the active tourney leaderboard
- merge !leaderboard and !history? They serve similar functions, could be combined maybe
- come up with a way to have all "technical" errors get routed to a private channel in the discord to notify me in a more timely and active manner
- disable Q responding to mentions, its obnoxious
